# 6. Email List & Registration Module - Mailchimp Implementation

## What I Did

- Created a new email list in Mailchimp named **"Test Registration List"** for this demo.
- Used Mailchimp's form builder to generate a clean, simple signup form with **Email**, **First Name**, and **Last Name** fields.
- Embedded the Mailchimp form into a custom landing page with some styling.
- Applied custom CSS for a modern, clean design that is fully responsive on mobile and desktop.  
  Since the Mailchimp free plan does not allow custom CSS directly, I had to **override the default styles**.
- Tested submissions to confirm emails correctly reach the Mailchimp list - **all emails are collected and stored in the list**.
- This project showcases my ability to:
  - Integrate external marketing tools (in this case Mailchimp)
  - Customize appearance
  - Maintain full functionality and responsiveness within a web page

> ðŸ’¡ There are way more options for styling, customization, validation, etc.
